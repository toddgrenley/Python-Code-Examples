# Python-Code-Examples
Several samples of Python code from Coursera's Python Specialization

These are some examples of web-scraping performed with Python. They perform similar functions, the first two using xml (eXtensible Markup Language), and the second two using 
json. But the 'geo' in the file names tells you they all pull location data from the web in some form, accessing Google Maps to do so. The first one of each provides simple 
latitude and longitude while the second ones provide more location details.
